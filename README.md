# Voyager Rover Test

### Running Locally

... TODO: add instructions

Note: If you need to install new dependencies or perform changes outside the `packages/**/src/**` (e.g.: change environment variables), you'll need to rebuild the images

```sh
docker compose down --rmi all
```

And then restart the services:

```sh
docker-compose up
```
