# Voyager Rover Test

### Running Locally

... TODO: add instructions

Note: If you need to install new dependencies or perform changes outside the `packages/**/src/**` (e.g.: install a new dependency) you'll need to run `docker compose up --build --force-recreate`. Only changes within the referred folders are "synced" with the running containers.
